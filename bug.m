In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:`.  If the selector targets a method that's deallocated before the delay expires, it results in a crash. This often manifests as an EXC_BAD_ACCESS exception.  A common scenario involves scheduling a selector on a temporary object that's released before the timer fires.  Another less common scenario is using a selector that is invalid in a particular class or situation. This invalid selector could result in unpredictable behavior.
